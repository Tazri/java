Chapter 07 : Object Oriented Programming
========================================

> ðŸŸ¢ Object Oriented Programmng is a programming rules where common bulding block of programming is object.

A object has two thing : 
1. State
2. Behavior.

## Adventage of object oriented programming
Here is adventage of object oriented programming : 

1. This system is very modular. Because all object work differently each other. That's why make them differently.
2. This system make the component reusable.
3. Maintenance is easy.
4. Easy to add new feature.

A object oriented programming based on three concept : 
<details>
<summary>1. Encapsulation</summary>
This way object hide the property or data and method from outside.
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Inheritance </summary>
This way a class inherit the others class method and feilds.
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Polymorphism </summary>
A object can various form in different time by polymorphism.
</details>

## Application of Object Oriented Programming

**Here details about three important relation between two object :**

<details>
<summary>Composition</summary>

Think about two object `a` and `b`. If `a` is a independed object where `b` is depened on `a`. This type of relation called composition.

<details>
<summary>Aggregation Relation</summary>

Think about two object `a` and `b`, `a` and `b` are depended. `b` can be relation with one or more `a` type of object. This type of relation called aggregation relation.

<details>
<summary>Inheritance Relation </summary>

If a object inherit some feature from another object, this type of relation called inheritance.
